# Intercom Setup Guide for BEEP Chatbot (Development Environment)

This guide walks you through setting up the BEEP Chatbot in a **development workspace** where you can safely experiment before moving to production.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: We're setting everything up in a development environment first:
- Development Intercom workspace
- Development Render services  
- Development Neon PostgreSQL database
- This is a safe space to test and experiment!

```

## üöÄ Development Deployment to Render

We'll deploy everything to a development environment first - this is your safe space to experiment!

### 1. Initial Render Development Deployment ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Web Service Created:
- [x] Service Name: BeepChatBot
- [x] Service ID: srv-d20t6695pdvs739e186g
- [x] Build Command: `npm install`
- [x] Start Command: `npm start`
- [x] Region: Singapore
- [x] Plan: Free tier
- [x] All environment variables configured
- [x] Currently deployed and running

#### Still Need to Create:
- [ ] Background Worker Service:
   - Name: `beep-chatbot-worker-dev`
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `npm run start:worker`
   - Plan: **Free**
   - Same environment variables as API

‚ö†Ô∏è **Development Notes**: 
- Free tier services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity - that's normal!
- First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
- This is perfect for development testing and costs $0
- Logs are retained even when services sleep

### 2. Get Your Development URLs ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Your deployed service URLs:
- API URL: `https://beepchatbot-development.onrender.com`
- Webhook URL: `https://beepchatbot-development.onrender.com/webhook`
- Health Check: `https://beepchatbot-development.onrender.com/health`

### 3. Configure Webhook with Development URL
Now go back to your development Intercom workspace and set the webhook URL.

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### Test Webhook on Render
Once deployed to Render:

1. **Check Health Endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl https://beepchatbot-development.onrender.com/health
   ```
   Note: First request might take 30-60 seconds if service was sleeping

2. **Test Webhook Directly**
   ```bash
   # Update WEBHOOK_URL to your development Render URL
   WEBHOOK_URL=https://beep-chatbot-api-dev.onrender.com/webhook npm run test:webhook
   
   # Or use the --url flag:
   npm run test:webhook -- --url=https://beep-chatbot-api-dev.onrender.com/webhook
   
   # Test different scenarios:
   npm run test:webhook -- --url=https://beep-chatbot-api-dev.onrender.com/webhook --scenario=foodpanda
   npm run test:webhook -- --url=https://beep-chatbot-api-dev.onrender.com/webhook --scenario=order-not-found
   ```

3. **Monitor Logs in Render**
   - Go to your service in Render Dashboard
   - Click on "Logs" tab
   - Watch for incoming webhook events

### Verify Deployment
- [ ] Health check returns healthy status
- [ ] Webhook test receives 200 OK response
- [ ] Logs show webhook processing
- [ ] Worker logs show job processing

## üìä Post-Setup Verification

### Test Order Status Query
1. Start a conversation in Intercom
2. Send: "Where is my order LM12345678?"
3. Bot should respond with order status or create ticket

### Check Database
```sql
-- Check recent lookups
SELECT * FROM order_lookups ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check bot interactions
SELECT * FROM bot_interactions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Monitor Performance
```sql
-- View hourly metrics
SELECT * FROM hourly_metrics ORDER BY hour DESC LIMIT 24;
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Receiving Events
1. Check webhook URL in Intercom
2. Verify webhook secret matches
3. Check ngrok tunnel is running (for local)
4. Monitor app logs

### Authentication Errors
1. Verify access token has correct permissions
2. Check token hasn't expired
3. Ensure bot admin ID is correct

### API Connection Issues
1. Verify all API credentials
2. Check API endpoints are correct
3. Monitor rate limits
4. Check circuit breaker status in logs

## üöÄ Moving to Production (After Development Testing)

Once you've tested everything in the development environment and are ready for production:

### Production Deployment Steps
1. **Create Production Services**:
   - New Neon project: "beep-chatbot-prod"
   - New Render services without "-dev" suffix
   - Upgrade to paid plans for always-on service

2. **Production Intercom Setup**:
   - Use production Intercom workspace
   - Create new production app
   - Generate production credentials

3. **Environment Separation**:
   - Development: beep-chatbot-api-dev.onrender.com
   - Production: beep-chatbot-api.onrender.com
   - Never mix credentials between environments!

4. **Database Migration**:
   - Export any test data worth keeping
   - Set up fresh production database
   - Run migrations on production

---

Remember:
- üß™ **Development First**: Test everything in dev environment
- üîê **Keep Credentials Separate**: Dev and prod credentials should never mix
- üìù **Document Changes**: Track what works in dev before moving to prod
- üéØ **Safe to Experiment**: Break things in dev, not in prod!
